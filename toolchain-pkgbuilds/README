toolchain-pkgbuilds
-------------------

this directory contains the pkgbuilds required to bootstrap parabola-riscv64

build order:
  - riscv64-linux-gnu-binutis
  - riscv64-linux-gnu-linux-libre-api-headers
  - riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc-bootstrap (modified to compile without glibc)
  - riscv64-linux-gnu-glibc
  - riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc (supersedes gcc-bootstrap)
  - riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb

riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc-bootstrap is not needed after the toolchain packages have
been built, so it might be removed from the package repositories in the future.
However, the PKGBUILD file will continue to exist in this repository as a
reference point for future porting efforts.
