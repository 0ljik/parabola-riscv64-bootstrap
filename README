parabola-riscv64-bootstrap
==========================

an attempt at creating a self-contained parabola GNU/Linux-libre system on the
riscv64 architecture.

prerequesites
-------------

to create parabola-riscv64, you need a riscv64-linux-gnu toolchain. On parabola
GNU/Linux-libre, this toolchain has been pre-packaged and can be installed by
invoking:

  $> pacman -S riscv64-linux-gnu-{gcc,gdb}

the PKGBUILDS used for building these packages, as well as documentation
towards the process of bootstrapping the toolchain is included in the
subdirectory `toolchain-pkgbuilds'.
