+# REPOSITORIES
+#   - can be defined here or included from another file
+#   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
+#   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
+#   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
+#     have identical names, regardless of version number
+#   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
+#   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
+#
+# Repository entries are of the format:
+#       [repo-name]
+#       Server = ServerName
+#       Include = IncludePath
+#
+# The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
+# uncommented to enable the repo.
+#
+
+# The testing repositories are disabled by default. To enable, uncomment the
+# repo name header and Include lines. You can add preferred servers immediately
+# after the header, and they will be used before the default mirrors.
